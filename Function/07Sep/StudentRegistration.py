1. Student Registration System - Longest Name

A school is organizing an inter-school cultural event. During the registration process, the coordinator notices that some students have very long names, which may not fit properly on the printed ID cards.

As a software developer, your task is to write a Python program that identifies the student with the longest name from the list of registered students using the reduce() function along with a lambda expression.

Input
students = ["Riya", "Christopher", "Aman", "Neha", "Siddharth"]
Expected Output
Student with the longest name: Christopher

from functools import reduce

student = input("Enter Names of Student: ").split()
result = reduce(lambda x,y: x if len(y)<len(x) else y,student) 
print(result)
