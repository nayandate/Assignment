6. Automorphic Number Checker

A digital security company designs smart lockers that open only for special self-matching numeric codes. When a user enters a number, the system squares the number and checks whether the result ends with the same digits as the original code. If yes, the locker grants access.

An automorphic number is a number whose square ends with the same number.

Example:
25² = 625

Write a program using loops to check whether the entered number is an Automorphic number.

Input:
25

Output:
Automorphic Number
'''
n = int(input("Enter Number = "))

temp = n
sq = n*n
count = 0
while n>0:
     if  sq%10 != n%10:
           print("Not Automorphic Number")
           break
     n = n//10
     sq = sq//10
else:
     print("Automorphic Number")
