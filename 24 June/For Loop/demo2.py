2. Factorial of a Number
In project scheduling, tasks are dependent on previous tasks, and the total number of ways to arrange them is calculated using factorial. Factorial of a number n is the product of all numbers from 1 to n.
Write a program to calculate the *factorial of a given number using loops*.

Input: n = 5
Output: Total Ways = 120
'''

n = int(input("Number = "))
sum=1

for i in range(1,n+1,1):
    sum=sum*i
    i=i+1
print("Total ways : ",sum)
